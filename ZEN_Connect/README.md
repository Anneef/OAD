## ZEN Connect

**Overlay and Organize Images From Any Source to Connect Your Multimodal Data**

* combine multiple perspectives of your sample across scales and imaging modalities
* organize and navigate inside any image â€“ ZEISS or not due to 3rd party import
* acquire an overview image of your large sample on a low magnification system, then switch or move to your confocal or electron microscope and align.
* Use the aligned overview image for navigation and all subsequent images will automatically be shown in context.
* Simply use ZEN Connect to align and overlay images from any source.
